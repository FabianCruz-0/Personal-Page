## *The IDEA behind my Navigation bar (Nav-bar) Implementation.*

You can see in my page that the navbar it keeps always responsive and the items stay where they should. 


I use the simplest Nav-bar of bootstrap for better manipulation, but Â¿What is the problem with that? <br>
That Nav-bar by default have some issues:

* The height isn't responsive.
* The text isn't responsive.
* If I change some values of the text, it lost all of the Nav-bar format by Bootstrap.
* The alignement of the text. The default alignement is all to the left.

The idea and how I fixed.

Since the Bootstrap's items are on an unordened list, I can't manipulate using the *`float`*. <br>
I came up with using **<ins>positive and negative margins with pxiels, viewport width and percentages<ins>**.

The nav-bar "Brand" (My name) have a margin positive to the right, but also a margin negative to the left.

The unordened list  have a margin negative percent to the left.

### *The magic about the use of positive and negative margins with pxiels, viewport width and percentages in the nav-bar:* <br>
Given a positive margin towards the x axis, a negative margin along the same axis, but <ins>**WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE**</ins> , it allows a new calculation of the occupied percentage of the screen with respect to the attribute *`viewport Width`* while the screen is getting smaller in width.
